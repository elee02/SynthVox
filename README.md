## Quick Start üöÄ

### 1. Clone a Voice
Clone a voice from an audio sample:

```python
from synthvox import VoiceCloner

# Initialize the voice cloner
cloner = VoiceCloner()

# Clone a voice from an audio file
cloner.clone_voice("path/to/audio.wav", "output_model.onnx")

# Generate speech using the cloned voice
cloner.generate_speech("Hello, world!", "output_speech.wav")
```

### 2. Generate Speech from Text
Generate speech using a pre-trained TTS model:

```python
from synthvox import TTSEngine

# Initialize the TTS engine
tts = TTSEngine()

# Generate speech from text
tts.synthesize("Welcome to SynthVox!", "output_speech.wav")
```

### 3. Use the CLI
SynthVox also comes with a command-line interface for quick tasks:

```bash
# Clone a voice
synthvox clone --input path/to/audio.wav --output output_model.onnx

# Generate speech
synthvox speak --text "Hello, world!" --output output_speech.wav
```
